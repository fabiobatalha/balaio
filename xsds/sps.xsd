Within a bibliographic reference citation, the subtitle cannot be preserved separately as this Tag Set identifies no cited-subtitle elements.</p><p>For references using either the &lt;element-citation&gt; or the &lt;nlm-citation&gt;, which do not permit untagged text, there are two choices: </p><ul class="bullist"><li>The subtitle may be included with the title in the &lt;article-title&gt; element (or the &lt;source&gt; element for book titles, proceedings titles, and other titles), or </li><li>The subtitle may be tagged as &lt;named-content&gt; with a @content-type                &#8220;<tt>subtitle</tt>&#8221;.</li></ul><p>For references using the &lt;mixed-citation&gt;, there are two choices: </p><ul class="bullist"><li>The subtitle may be included with the title in the &lt;article-title&gt; element (or the &lt;source&gt; element for book titles, proceedings titles, and other titles), or </li><li>The subtitle may be left as untagged characters within the text of the reference.</li></ul><p><strong>Best Practice in Citations:</strong> Although this Tag Set cannot enforce either practice, retrieval performance will be enhanced if the subtitle for all cited material is consistently placed within the &lt;article-title&gt; element for journal articles and within the &lt;source&gt; element for book titles, proceedings titles, and other documents. When marked as either a &lt;named-content&gt; or left as untagged text, the subtitle is easy to lose to searching.

This type of formatting may be guided by the value of the attribute, for example, making all circulatory system words (identified by a &lt;named-content&gt; element) red or putting a background image behind case studies.</p><p><strong>Historical Note:</strong> In Tag Set version 2.3, because &#8220;<tt>type</tt>&#8221; attributes were viewed as a useful tool for preserving Publisher semantics without extending the Tag Set, @content-type attributes were added to more than 60 elements according to the following rationale. </p><ul class="bullist"><li>Unless there was a conflicting rule, a @content-type attribute was added.</li><li>Elements that cannot repeat (such as &lt;body&gt; and &lt;title-group&gt;) were not given a @content-type attribute.

    <xs:annotation><xs:documentation><p>Container element for more than one version of a personal name, the element &lt;name&gt; (for example, the name written in both Japanese Kana characters and the  Latin alphabet).</p><p>The &lt;name-alternatives&gt; element is intended to collect multiple versions of a single name without appearing to multiply the number of names. (Three versions of a name is not the same as three different contributors.) Like the similar construction for graphics &lt;alternatives&gt;, it will be up to an application how multiple versions of a single name are to be processed. The @specific-use, @content-type, and @xml:lang attributes can be used to distinguish the cases for separate processing.</p><p><strong>Usage:</strong> The &lt;name-alternatives&gt; element can be used to record:</p><ul class="bullist"><li>A name in multiple languages (For example, a name in Korean or Chinese-Han characters and a transliterated version of the same name in the Latin alphabet);</li><li>A name in multiple language/script combinations (For example, a name in Japanese [<tt>xml:lang="ja-Jpan"</tt> for Han + Hiragana + Katakana] and the same name written in Kanji [<tt>xml:lang="ja-Hani"</tt>]);</li><li>An alternate name for sorting or searching (For example, a name in French with accented letters [such as an &#8220;&#233;&#8221;] and a plain-letter lower-ASCII version of the same name with &#8220;&#233;&#8221; replaced by &#8220;e&#8221; for sorting. The @specific-use attribute can be used to indicate that the ASCII version is only for &#8220;<tt>sort</tt>&#8221;, not for display.);</li><li>An alternate name indexing (For example, an XML database may need to record all the name variants found for an individual from &#8220;President Thomas Jefferson&#8221; to &#8220;Long Tom&#8221;, with @specific-use used to mark &#8220;<tt>primary</tt>&#8221; and &#8220;<tt>index</tt>&#8221;.); or</li><li>Both validated and known-to-be-incorrect names. (For example, in the PubMed DTD, there is an attribute called &#8220;<tt>ValidYN</tt>&#8221; [valid yes or no], that can be used to record the fact that one version of a name was received, found to be in error and corrected. Only the corrected version should be displayed, but both name variants might be used for searching.)</li></ul><p><strong>ID Attribute:</strong> The names inside a &lt;name-alternatives&gt; do not take a unique identifier because they are all the same name. This Tag Set assumes that any necessary unique identifier will be placed on the enclosing element (such as the &lt;contrib&gt;  element or the &lt;principal-investigator&gt;  element) that contains the name alternatives.</p><p><strong>String Name:</strong> Both &lt;name&gt; and &lt;string-name&gt; are allowed inside &lt;name-alternatives&gt;. Within a &lt;name-alternatives&gt; grouping, the element &lt;string-name&gt; can be used to hold an undifferentiated transliteration (one not tagged with specific name elements such as &lt;surname&gt;) or a search-specific name.</p><p><strong>Best Practice:</strong> For this Tag Set, the &lt;string-name&gt; within a &lt;name-alternatives&gt; should not be used for the primary name.

The idea was that names would be converted to this sequence during import conversion, allowing a publisher or archive to regularize the names in their repository, since names are frequently critical search items. However, that leaves the case of names where the component parts are not in the required order. If the name parts are unknown or untagged in the input to be converted, or if the name would require complex conversion processing, for example, &#8220;His Royal Highness The Prince Charles, Prince of Wales and Earl of Chester&#8221;, there are several options. The whole name can be put within the element &lt;string-name&gt; where that element is allowed (for example, within a bibliographic reference): </p><pre>&lt;string-name&gt;His Royal Highness The Prince Charles,  Prince of Wales and Earl of Chester &lt;/string-name&gt;  </pre><p>Since the &lt;string-name&gt; element permits the tagging of name parts within it, &#8220;Charles&#8221; could be tagged as a &lt;given-names&gt; element and the &lt;prefix&gt; and &lt;suffix&gt; element used to tag the remainder, but such tagging is likely to be rare.</p><p>If the complexity is less or the element &lt;string-name&gt; is not allowed in the context, the entire name can be placed into the &lt;surname&gt; element.

  <xs:element name="textual-form">
    <xs:annotation><xs:documentation><p>This element holds text (mixed content) in places where alternatives can bepresented, providing a textual alternative. For example, inside the &lt;alternatives&gt; wrapper element, a &lt;textual-form&gt; can provide an alternative version of an equation, graphic, or table. Thisalternative textual version may be a direct textual representation of an object (such as a Unicodevalue for a special character or the full text of an equation in ASCII characters), or a simplified textual version of the object (for display by devices not able to cope with the object), or a text-dump of the contents of a binary object (for example, the full text-dump of the cells of a table to accompany a graphical version of the table).</p><p><strong>Usage Display Alternative:</strong> One use of the &lt;textual-form&gt; element is inside a display object (such as an equation or figure) to provide an equivalent display alternative for a graphical object. For example, a display equation (&lt;disp-formula&gt;), may be provided in several equivalent, interchangeable forms within an &lt;alternatives&gt; element:</p><ul class="bullist"><li>as a MathML-encoded equation (&lt;mml:math&gt;), </li><li>as a plain text alternative which uses ASCII characters and superscripts (&lt;textual-form&gt;), and</li><li> as a &lt;graphic&gt; such as a <tt>tif</tt> or <tt>jpg</tt>.</li></ul><p>Similarly, a graphic can be provided with a <em>simpler</em> (as opposed to equivalent) alternative form, to provide gentle degradation for hardware that cannot process the graphical or media object.</p><p><strong>Usage Special Characters:</strong> The &lt;textual-form&gt; element can also be used to supply a textual or Unicode description of a special character that is being defined using a &lt;private-char&gt; element, as an alternative to bitmaps or graphics. For example, an &lt;alternatives&gt; element could be used to describe multiple ways of defining the character:</p><ul class="bullist"><li>one as an graphic (&lt;inline-graphic&gt;), </li><li>one as a bitmap (&lt;glyph-data&gt; bitmap inside  &lt;private-char&gt; element), and</li><li>one or more as textual alternatives (&lt;textual-form&gt;) to name alternative characters in the Unicode Standard that can be used to create a visual approximation of the character being defined.</li></ul>.<p><strong>Usage Search Text:</strong> The &lt;textual-form&gt; element can also be used to supply the text of an object for searching. In such a usage, it is not intended that the &lt;textual-form&gt; be displayed to the user, only that it provide a textual view of the object to a search system. This technique can allow unsearchable binary formats, such as graphics and untagged tables represented as graphics, to be represented in a form that can be searched or indexed.</p></xs:documentation></xs:annotation><xs:complexType mixed="true">

Sometimes the grouping or category refers to the type of article, such as &#8220;Essay&#8221;, &#8220;Commentary&#8221;, or &#8220;Article&#8221;. Sometimes the grouping refers to subject areas, such as &#8220;Physical Sciences&#8221;, &#8220;Biological Sciences&#8221;, or &#8220;Social Sciences&#8221;.

In print or display, a caption is usually recognizable because it is not part of the ordinary text flow; it sits just under, above, beside, or in the same small window or page area as the tabular portions of a table or the graphical portions of a figure. A &lt;caption&gt; may contain many kinds of text associated with its object, for example, a title (tagged as &lt;title&gt;), a descriptive paragraph (tagged as &lt;p&gt;), or a legend (which is not identified as a separate element in this Suite).</p><p>The text of the caption does not typically include words such as &#8220;Figure 3.&#8221; or &#8220;Table 11-a&#8221;. These labels may not be present in the XML file, since many publishers choose to generate such text at display time, but if they are in the source XML, they may be preserved using the &lt;label&gt; element.</p><p><strong>Best Practice:</strong> In many journal articles, a distinction is made between the caption of a figure/table/etc. and its title. There may be two separate tags (&lt;caption&gt; and &lt;title&gt;), or the first sentence of the caption may be set off typographically from the rest of the caption to indicate that it is a title, for example, the first sentence may be italic or bold. In either case, if it is obvious that the figure/table/etc. contains both a title and a caption, both the title and the caption should both be tagged during conversion, and the title should be moved inside the caption if it is outside.</p></xs:documentation></xs:annotation><xs:complexType>

    <xs:annotation><xs:documentation><p>Wrapper element for a complete table, including the tabular material (rows and columns), caption (including title), footnotes, and alternative descriptions of the table for purposes of accessibility.</p><p><strong>Table Content:</strong> This element has been designed to capture a construct named &#8220;table&#8221;, whether that structure contains an explicit &lt;table&gt; element or contains non-tabular structures such as graphics, lists, or paragraphs. Many publishers associate table captions and table numbers with material that is not explicitly tabular. Within the &lt;table-wrap&gt; element, row and column tags that describe the table cells should be defined by either the &lt;table&gt; element of the NISO JATS table model (based on and designed to be converted easily to the XHTML 1.1 table model) or, less typically, by the OASIS XML Exchange (CALS) table model.</p><p><strong>Related Essay:</strong> For a discussion on the use of &lt;table-wrap&gt;, see Table, Table Wrapper, and Table Group.</p><p>Within the &lt;table-wrap&gt; element, the row and column tags that describe the table cells are typicallydefined by the NISO JATS table model or the OASIS XML Exchange (CALS) table model.</p><p><strong>Design Note:</strong> Many journal tag sets use an element called &#8220;Table Footnote&#8221; (with a tag such as <tt>&lt;tblfn&gt;</tt>) for footnotes inside a table. This Tag Set uses &lt;fn&gt; inside tables, as well as everywhere else, relying instead on context to differentiate table footnotes. Footnotes inside a &lt;table-wrap&gt; are assumed to be footnotes to the table and, as part of the table, are displayed at the bottom of the table, usually as part of the &lt;table-wrap-foot&gt;, rather than at the bottom of the page or otherwise separated from the display of the table.</p><p><strong>Position:</strong> The @position attribute may be used to indicate whether a &lt;table-wrap&gt; must be anchored at its exact location within the text or whether it may float, for example, to the top of the next page, into the next column, to the end of a logical file, or within a separate window.</p><p><strong>NISO JATS Table Processing Note:</strong> In building the NISO JATS table model from the XHTML model, the &lt;caption&gt; element was removed from within the &lt;table&gt; element, because, in the NISO JATS Tag Suite, the &lt;caption&gt; element has been made part of the &lt;table-wrap&gt; element.</p></xs:documentation></xs:annotation><xs:complexType>

    <xs:annotation><xs:documentation><p>Reduced set of metadata for use in &lt;sub-article&gt; and &lt;response&gt;, both of which      are contained within an article. Any metadata not explicitly tagged in the front-stub is      inherited from &lt;article-meta&gt; in the enclosing article.</p><p><strong>Usage:</strong> A front stub is used when a publisher or              archive chooses not to repeat all the article metadata (journal metadata, issue              metadata, etc.) for an embedded component, but assigns a sub-article that metadata              (such as title, first page, and possibly contributor) that is particular to it and is              not shared with the main article. The assumption is that the sub-articles will inherit              any metadata from &lt;article-meta&gt; in the              enclosing article that is not defined in the &lt;front-stub&gt;.</p><p>In this Tag Set, the possible metadata elements for the &lt;front-stub&gt; is very nearly the same as the possible metadata elements for the entire article (&lt;article-meta&gt; inside &lt;article&gt;). The two are so similar because, while the metadata for the stub will almost always contain many fewer elements, this Tag Set does not wish to predict which elements a given publisher or archive will leave out. It is a business decision how much metadata to place in a sub-article.</p><p>The difference between the two is that everything is optional in &lt;front-stub&gt;, since it is expected to be a small subset, while the metadata for the full article (&lt;article-meta&gt;) requires the elements &lt;article-title&gt; and &lt;pub-date&gt;.</p></xs:documentation></xs:annotation><xs:complexType>
